Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

Chapter 1: Arrays and Lists

An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays allow random access to elements using an index, which makes retrieval operations very efficient with O(1) time complexity.

Key Characteristics of Arrays:
- Fixed size (in most languages)
- Elements stored contiguously in memory
- Fast access using indices
- Efficient for sequential access

Common Array Operations:
1. Access - O(1)
2. Search - O(n)
3. Insertion - O(n)
4. Deletion - O(n)

Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

Types of Linked Lists:
1. Singly Linked List - Each node points to the next node
2. Doubly Linked List - Each node points to both next and previous nodes
3. Circular Linked List - Last node points back to the first node

Advantages of Linked Lists:
- Dynamic size
- Efficient insertion/deletion at beginning
- No memory wastage

Disadvantages:
- No random access
- Extra memory for pointers
- Not cache-friendly

Time Complexity Comparison:

Operation       | Array  | Linked List
----------------|--------|-------------
Access          | O(1)   | O(n)
Search          | O(n)   | O(n)
Insert at start | O(n)   | O(1)
Insert at end   | O(1)   | O(n)
Delete at start | O(n)   | O(1)

Chapter 2: Stacks and Queues

Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

Common Stack Operations:
- Push: Add an element to the top
- Pop: Remove the top element
- Peek: View the top element without removing it
- isEmpty: Check if stack is empty

Applications of Stacks:
1. Function call management (call stack)
2. Expression evaluation
3. Backtracking algorithms
4. Browser history

Queue
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. The first element added is the first one to be removed.

Common Queue Operations:
- Enqueue: Add element to the rear
- Dequeue: Remove element from the front
- Front: View the front element
- isEmpty: Check if queue is empty

Types of Queues:
1. Simple Queue
2. Circular Queue
3. Priority Queue
4. Double-ended Queue (Deque)

Applications of Queues:
1. Process scheduling
2. Breadth-first search
3. Print spooling
4. Request handling in web servers

Chapter 3: Trees

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. It has a root node and subtrees of children nodes.

Binary Tree Terminology:
- Root: The topmost node
- Parent: Node with children
- Child: Node with a parent
- Leaf: Node with no children
- Height: Length of longest path from root to leaf
- Depth: Length of path from root to a specific node

Binary Search Tree (BST)
A binary search tree is a binary tree where:
- Left subtree contains nodes with values less than parent
- Right subtree contains nodes with values greater than parent
- Both subtrees are also BSTs

BST Operations:
- Search: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case
- Insertion: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case
- Deletion: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case

Tree Traversal Methods:
1. Inorder (Left, Root, Right)
2. Preorder (Root, Left, Right)
3. Postorder (Left, Right, Root)
4. Level Order (Breadth-first)

Summary

Understanding data structures is fundamental to writing efficient algorithms. Each structure has its strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right one depends on the specific requirements of your application.

Key Takeaways:
- Arrays provide fast access but fixed size
- Linked lists offer dynamic sizing with slower access
- Stacks follow LIFO principle
- Queues follow FIFO principle
- Trees provide hierarchical organization
- BSTs enable efficient searching when balanced

Practice Problems:
1. Implement a stack using arrays
2. Reverse a linked list
3. Check if parentheses are balanced using a stack
4. Implement a queue using two stacks
5. Find the height of a binary tree
6. Perform inorder traversal of a BST
