# Plant Biology

## 📘 Overview

Plants are multicellular organisms that perform photosynthesis to convert light energy into chemical energy, forming the foundation of most terrestrial ecosystems.

## 🎯 Key Concepts

- **Photosynthesis**: Process by which plants convert light energy into glucose using CO2 and water
- **Cellular Respiration**: Breakdown of glucose to release ATP energy for cellular activities
- **Transpiration**: Water movement through plants and evaporation from leaves

## 🔑 Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Stoma** | Small opening in leaf surface that regulates gas exchange |
| **Xylem** | Vascular tissue that transports water and minerals upward |
| **Phloem** | Vascular tissue that transports sugars throughout the plant |

## 📚 Summary

Plants utilize photosynthesis and respiration to maintain energy balance while specialized structures like stomata, xylem, and phloem enable efficient resource distribution.

```markdown
## Detailed Notes


### Photosynthesis
- Happens in chloroplasts
- Uses light
- Makes sugar

### Cell Respiration
- Opposite of photosynthesis
- Releases energy
```

### ✅ After
```markdown
## 📝 Detailed Notes

### Photosynthesis

- **Location**: Occurs in chloroplasts, specifically in thylakoid membranes and stroma
- **Inputs**: Requires carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and light energy
- **Outputs**: Produces glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2) as byproduct
- **Equation**: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light → C6H12O6 + 6O2

### Cellular Respiration

- **Location**: Occurs in mitochondria with glycolysis starting in cytoplasm
- **Purpose**: Breaks down glucose to release ATP energy for cellular work
- **Process**: Includes glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and electron transport chain
- **Equation**: C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP

# Introduction to Biology

## 📘 Overview

This document introduces fundamental biological concepts including cellular structure, genetic information storage and expression, and the distinction between plant and animal systems.

## 🎯 Key Concepts

- **Cell Theory**: All living organisms are composed of one or more cells, which are the basic units of life
- **DNA & Genetics**: Genetic information is stored in DNA and expressed through RNA and proteins
- **Plant vs Animal Cells**: Plants have cell walls and chloroplasts; animals have centrioles and are more flexible

## 📝 Main Points

- Cells are the smallest units of life capable of independent function
- DNA contains instructions for building and maintaining organisms
- RNA acts as messenger between DNA and protein synthesis machinery
- Proteins perform most cellular functions and provide structure

## 🔑 Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **DNA** | Deoxyribonucleic acid - double helix molecule storing genetic information |
| **RNA** | Ribonucleic acid - single strand that transcribes and translates genetic code |
| **Protein** | Large biomolecules composed of amino acids that perform cellular functions |
| **Cell Membrane** | Phospholipid bilayer controlling substance movement in and out of cells |

## 💡 Must-Know Points

- All cells share common features: membrane, genetic material, cytoplasm, and ribosomes
- Central Dogma: DNA → RNA → Protein (genetic information flow)
- Cell specialization allows complex organisms to perform diverse functions

## 📚 Summary

Cells form the foundation of all life, with DNA storing information that RNA helps translate into functional proteins. Understanding cellular structure and genetic expression is essential for comprehending all biological processes.
